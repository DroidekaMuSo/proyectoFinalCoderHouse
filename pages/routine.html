        <article>
          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">What is the best routine for the gym?</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p> The best routine for the gym is one that is flexible with your schedule and you actually enjoy. These two factors will contribute greatly to your ability to be consistent with your workouts. Consistency with your workouts and progressing as you perform them is what will lead to results.</p>

            <p> being said, there are plenty of great workout program styles one can do to build muscle, lose fat, or build strength. The body composition goals (building muscle and losing fat) will be accomplished through similar style workouts combined with differing nutritional principles, while those looking for strength gains may need to focus on programs that are centered on the idea of specificity.</p>
            
            <p> sum that statement up, if you want to change your body composition, you'll want to train with volume. If you want to build strength, you'll want a program that is strength specific for the lifts you want to improve such as the bench press, squat and deadlift.</p>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">What body parts to work on what days?</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p>The answer to this question would assume that the person asking is referring to body part splits. In this case, the way you split your days likely won't matter too much, as long as you work every body part throughout the week.</p>

            <p>There may be some benefit into ensuring you don't hit chest and shoulders or legs and back on consecutive days, but if you do, it probably won't be that big of an issue depending on your overall strength levels.</p>
              
            <p>However, if you are looking to optimize your training by incorporating a higher training frequency (hitting each muscle group more often throughout the week), you may want to look into pairing certain muscle groups on certain workout days.</p>
              
            <p>The most popular pairings are full body workouts, upper/lower workouts, push/pull workouts and push/pull/legs workouts.</p> 
              
            <p> Again, the actual days you put your workouts on likely won't make that much of a difference to the overall outcome of your training so long as you are consistent with your workouts and implement progressive overload (increasing the weight used) over time.</p>
          </div>

        <article>
          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">What should a beginner do at the gym</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p>The best thing a beginner can do at the gym is seek out the help of a trained professional to assist them with learning the proper form of each exercise. Practicing the basics and establishing a solid foundation in terms of form will help a beginner lifter remain injury free throughout their life.</p>

            <p> If you are not in the position to hire a trained professional, you may want to proceed working out with some level of caution. The same recommendation of practicing the fundamentals still applies. Start off with light weight (the bar on barbell exercises) and record yourself performing exercises.</p>
              
            <p> With the exercise recordings, compare your form with examples of proper form. Evaluate how you are moving and progress from there by either working on your form, or after you've mastered your form, adding weight.</p>

        <article>
          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">What is the best workout routine for beginners</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p>The best workout routine for true beginners is rather subjective to what the beginner is comfortable doing and their understanding of how to perform exercises.</p>

            <p> Their ultimate goal will also play a huge factor as well.</p>
              
            <p> Generally speaking though, beginners can start off performing anywhere between 2-4 workouts per week. These workouts can be either full body workouts or upper/lower workouts.</p>
              
            <p> The workouts should focus on learning ideal movement patterns of fundamental lifts such as horizontal presses, vertical presses, horizontal pulls, vertical pulls, squats, hip hinges, and loaded carries.</p>
              
            <p> There are several beginner workout routines on Muscle & Strength that can give beginners a template to start off with.</p>

          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">What is the best workout schedule to build Muscle</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p>The best workout schedule to build muscle is a workout schedule that you enjoy and can be consistent with.</p>

            <p> In addition to consistency, it would be beneficial to have a higher training frequency if the goal is to build lean muscle mass. You'll want to hit each muscle group either directly or indirectly 2-3 times weekly to maximize muscle growth.</p>
              
            <p> Some great splits to look into would be full body work>outs, upper/lower workouts, push/pull workouts and push/pull/legs workouts.</p>

          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">What are the 10 best exercises</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p>The best 10 exercises for someone might not be the best 10 exercise for another person. When selecting an exercise to use, it's important to keep your own abilities and goals in mind. Some people might be able to perform an exercise with no pain at all, while that same exercise might cause another a lot of pain. If it hurts, don't do it and find an alternative.</p>

            <p>That being said, there are certainly important movement patterns that everyone who is capable should try to train.</p> 
              
            <p>The following exercises are my personal favorite 10 exercises that would be fantastic to include in your workouts. However, like I said, you may need to substitute these with a variation that is better suited for your individual body type, training experience, and needs.</p>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>Trap Bar Deadlift</li>
                <li>Front Squat</li>
                <li>Barbell Glute Bridge</li>
                <li>Bulgarian Split Squat</li>
                <li>Military Press</li>
                <li> Pull Up</li>
                <li>Barbell Row</li>
                <li>Barbell Bench Press</li>
                <li>Farmers Walk</li>
                <li>Dip</li>

          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">How do I schedule my workout at the gym</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p>This all boils down to setting up and selecting workout programs that are both flexible and enjoyable. There is no perfect one way to set up training. It's very subjective from person to person.</p>

            <p> If you only have 2 days where you're able to make it to the gym, a full body workout makes sense. 3 days? Full body makes sense, push/pull/legs can work as well if that is what you enjoy. The more days you have available, the more split and scheduling options you'll have.</p>
              
            <p>Start off by figuring out how many and what days you can make it to the gym regularly. Then, look to schedule your training on those days. Find a workout that doesn't require any more than that total training frequency. Then, look for something where if you miss a training day, you're able to make it up throughout the week or already train that muscle more than once per week.</p>

          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">What is a good gym routine?</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p>A good gym routine is one that you enjoy, works your muscles with the appropriate frequency and volume for your experience level, and that you can be consistent with.</p>

            <p>This can look very different from person to person.</p>
              
            <p> Exercise selection for a good gym routine will train fundamental movement patterns (push, pull, lunge, hip hinge, squat, and carry) in a way that you are comfortable performing them. There is a pain-free variation for nearly every body type who can healthily perform these movements.</p>
              
            <p>A good gym routine also focuses on progression. This means making the workouts more challenging in some way from week to week, or training phase to training phase as you get more advanced.</p>

          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">How many days a week should I work out</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p>How many days per week do you have available to work out? That is the more important question to answer.</p>

            <p>Generally, to see progress 2-4 workouts are needed. 3-4 workouts per week is the sweet spot. You can train more frequently depending on your goals and experience level. However, at least 2 days of resistance training per week is needed to see muscle growth.</p>
              
            <p> With that being said, during your training days, it is beneficial to perform full body workouts (2-3 training days per week) or upper/lower workouts (4 days per week). This will allow you to train with an optimal frequency to build or maintain lean body mass.</p>

          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">What is a good 5 day workout routine</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p> A good 5 day workout routine would be an upper/lower workout or push/pull/legs workout performed in a rotating training day fashion. You could also do an upper/lower or push/pull split with a “weaknesses” day as your 5th training day in the week.</p>

            <p> I'd recommend avoiding the traditional body part split if optimizing your training is your goal. However, they can still be useful if you're simply working out for pure enjoyment purposes.</p>

          <h4 class="subtitle p-2 my-3">What should I do on rest days</h4>
          <div class="answer container-fluid my-5">
            <p>Rest on your rest days. Eat in a way that is consistent with your goals and focus on recovering from your training sessions.</p>

            <p>You can also do something that is known as active recovery. Active recovery can be performed in a number of ways but is a light activity that gets your blood flowing, isn't stressful, and helps you recover.</p>
            
            <p>Some examples of active recovery include recovery walks, yoga, and mobility work.</p>
